# Define two sets
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}

# Perform Union operation
union_set = E.union(N)

print("Intersection of E and N is", intersection_set)

# Perform Difference operation (E - N)

OUTPUT

Union of E and N is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Intersection of E and N is {2, 4}
Difference of E and N is {8, 0, 6}
Symmetric difference of E and N is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
